# NBA Teams

A front-end, single-page application built with React, ReactBootstrap JavaScript, and CSS that utilizes third-party data from https://www.balldontlie.io/ that allows users to explore NBA teams, players, and games. 

- Teams are displayed in the form of table & rows and are displayed in alphabetical order by city - users can toggle ascending or descending order by clicking the arrow in the city column header.

- Clicking on a row will highlight the selected team and will open a side panel that displays detailed information of a game played by the team in season 2021.

- Using the search bar will provide a list of player search results in a separate side panel. Clicking on a player will open a modal displaying the selected player's stats.
